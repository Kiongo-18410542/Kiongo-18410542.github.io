                </picture> <p>Anime is an abbreviation of the word animation. In Japan the word refers to all forms of animation. However, outside japan, it become a word to describe animation from Japan. <br><br>
                    The reason I love anime is because it’s different to most American animation like “Batman” and “Spider-man”. The difference can be seen in the artwork of storytelling, breadth of material and even cultural nuances exhibited by the characters. <br>
                    One of the longest anime running is One Piece which is still on air for 20 years! It is one of my favourite because of the world, characters and emotional connection with the viewers.

                </picture> <p>I learnt to play chess during secondary school. My friends and I would sit down and play it for hours. I enjoy chess because it’s a thought-provoking game of strategy and planning. It’s a wonderful game of clinical thinking and logic. It is a game to test one’s intelligence.</p>

                <p>Politics is a topic that we can’t escape from. Especially since at the moment the UK is in a process of leaving the EU. The talk of Brexit is everywhere. I studied politics for A LEVELS and once I knew how the system works, I got interested. I used to think my vote didn’t matter that much and my opinion isn’t relevant. It still doesn’t matter but collectively if others think like me and vote it would.</p>

                <p>Games have always been part of my childhood. It started with playing tag with my friends at primary school. As I got older, I started to play computer games. Runescape is an online multiplayer game that I played a lot as a child and other games such as Pokemon Arena and Club Penguin. There was a period where I played Nintendo 64 and games like Mario, Golden Eye and Zelda.  As I got older, gaming consoles got better and I got Playstation 2 where I had most of my favourite childhood memories. Games like Timesplitter, GTA San Andreas, Bully and the Godfather to name a few of my top games I loved. Currently I use the Playstation 4 Pro to play my games but I previously had Xbox 360 for a year and playstation 3 for about 3 years. GTA 5 is one of the best game I’ve ever played and the Assasin’s Creed franchise is one of my favourite along with Uncharted series. </p>

                <picture> <img src="images/cinema2.png" alt="Cinema seats"></picture>
                <p> When it comes to relaxing, Cinema tops it. Sunday has become a special day for me because it a day I forget about work or tasks I must do and take a rest. On a normal Sunday, I would go Church (not that often though) and if there’s a goof film out, I would then go cinema and enjoy a film. I have gone cinema with my family, friends and even dates on a Sunday. It’s a great day to socialise. <br>
                <br>My top 5 favourite films of all time are; The GodFather trilogy, Inception , Batman The Dark Knight, The Avengers and Dragon ball Z Broly

                <p>Game of Thrones is the best TV series of all time. The budget in this series is high and it pays of immensely. The character development, the story narrative and acting skills are top notch in this series. I like watching stuff that has a sense of mystery and keeps us guessing. When you can have theories about the plot that’s when I’m hooked. <br> <br>
                Furthermore, currently I also love, Stranger Things a Netflix Original series. The child actors in this show are amazing and the banter they have on screen are relatable to my younger self. Again, there’s a sense of mystery in the show that keeps me invested to know the truth. Prison Break, Breaking Bad and Narcos are also my favourites. Each are leagues above other tv shows in my honest opinion.
